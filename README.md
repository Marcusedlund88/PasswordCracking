# Brute Force Password Cracking for Educational Purposes
This repo is meant to showcase security vulnerabilities and how a brute force algoritm can crack non secure passwords

## Overview

This project provides a simple implementation of brute force password cracking. It's important to note that this project is not intended for any malicious activities. Instead, it serves as an educational tool to understand how brute force attacks work and how to defend against them.

## Introduction

Brute force password cracking is a method used to gain unauthorized access to a system or account by trying all possible password combinations until the correct one is found. This project demonstrates how to implement a simple brute force attack on a mock login system.
